# Written Evaluation

Lastly, please provide a markdown file with the answers to the following questions below.  

The product team has decided that we want to make a change to this application such that authors of a blog post can have different roles:  

- Authors can be owners, editors, or viewers of a blog post. For any blog post, there must always be at least one owner of the blog post. Only owners of a blog post can modify the authors' list to a blog post (adding more authors, changing their role).  

## Notes:
- It is possible to refactor and restructure this project to better meet given criteria, however sometimes it is also a matter of the system design: return on over-engineering is minimal if the project is small and it is known that it won't be extended in the future.
- Possible improvements:
    1. Error Handling Structure (without try/catch )
    2. Better use of middleware
    3. Following design patterns: better use of controller helper functions
    4. Optimizing function comments for JSDoc/Doxygen
- Other improvements are noted in corresponding TODOs for each function.
- Please also note that I haven't worked that much with backend on Express/Node, so I am pretty sure there are certain things that can be done better. 

## Questions:
- What database changes would be required to the starter code to allow for different roles for authors of a blog post? Imagine that weâ€™d want to also be able to add custom roles and change the permission sets for certain roles on the fly without any code changes.    
**To implement roles and permissions into the current system, the best solution would be to create a new Role table which will store a set number of roles along with permissions and implement a relationship of UserPost has one Role. It will allow to know what Role User has on a particular Post and customize Roles on the fly to meet product team requirements. 
There are many ways on how to achieve this, however most flexible yet little bit more complicated way is described below:**  

```
UserPost (User to Post to Role)
    user_id: User
    post_id: Post
    role_id: Role
    
Role (belongs to UserPost, has many Permissions through PermissionRole)
    id: Role
    name: string
    description: string
    ...
    
Permission (many to many relation with Role)
    id: Permission
    name: string
    description: string
    
PermissionRole
    role_id: Role
    permission_id: Permission
```
Now one can easily create different roles that can have different permissions, and assign one or more roles to each user in a given post.  
I would also conisder having a polymorphic relations in this DB or using a third party authorization/authentification service.  

- How would you have to change the PATCH route given your answer above to handle roles?
    * I wouldn't change the PATCH route itself but change its behaviour to introduce new authorization features instead.
    * For example, implementing a middleware that will check for permissions authenticated user has for this post, and if it is not authorized for certain actions, return 403.
    * Creation of helper methods to handle and check for permissions will be neccessary
    * To ensure proper behaviour, it would be needed to thoroughly check different restrictions and constraints as to not create impossible situations (for example, Post with no authors, Role with no Permissions, User without a Role, etc.)

## Considerations
- [x] Please format your answers so that they are easy to digest, and do not include any code in your pull request related to these questions above. We will be evaluating both the quality of your answer as well as the quality of your written explanation of that answer.
- [x] Please include a file in the root of the repo called roles-proposal.md that addresses these questions.
